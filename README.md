# MyReads Project

The MyReads project is a bookshelf app that empowers users to categorize books into different shelves: "Currently Reading," "Want to Read," and "Read." Users can effortlessly search for books and seamlessly organize them into their desired shelves.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```
    cd MyReads
    ```

3. Install the dependencies:
    ```
    npm install
    ```

4. Start the development server:
    ```
    npm start
    ```

The app should now be running on http://localhost:3000. Open this URL in your web browser to access the app.

## Usage

Once the app is running, you will be greeted by the main page showcasing your bookshelves. Effortlessly move books between shelves by using the dropdown menu on each book and selecting the desired shelf.

To explore and add new books to your collection, click on the search icon in the top right corner of the page. Enter a search query in the search bar and press Enter. The search results will be displayed below, and you can add books to your shelves by selecting the desired shelf from the dropdown menu on each book.
